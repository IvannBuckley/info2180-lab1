<h2>[Ivanna Buckley]</h2> 
<p>[Ivanna Buckley is a twenty-two-year-old student at the University of 
The West Indies, Mona campus, where sheâ€™s pursuing a major in software 
engineering within the Faculty of Science. When she is not immersed in her 
studies, Ivanna enjoys indulging in her creative side by reading books and 
drawing.I am interested in web development because I love the creative 
aspect of designing and building websites. It's fascinating to see how a 
few lines of code can transform a concept into a fully functional and 
visually appealing website that can reach and connect with people all over 
the world. ]</p> </main> <footer>
